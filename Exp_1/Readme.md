# Analyze all references of the paper and download the corresponding bib file   
## Usage    
Enter the local pdf path of paper, and click 'чбошод'   
## Effect    
1. All references in the parsing pdf are showed in the Reference column of the window   
2. Create a folder with the same name as the pdf file in the folder where the main.py is located, and download the bib files of all references in this folder   
3. The command line will show the path of the successfully imported bib file and count it (also a separate count of failures)    
##### Note: The total number of failures and successes is usually significantly greater than the total number of references because of some special treatment in the program.
